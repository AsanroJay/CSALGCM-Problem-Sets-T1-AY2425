# CSALGCM - Term 2 AY 2425

This repository contains solutions to various problem sets and assignments for the course **CSALGCM (Algorithms and Complexity)** during **Term 2 of Academic Year 2425**.

## Course Overview
This course provides insights into the foundational concepts in the art and science — mostly the latter — of solving problems. An algorithm provides specifications to solve a "problem" on a "computer." In this course, we will explore the following topics:

- What exactly is a "problem"? Or a "computer"?
- If you are given two different algorithms to solve the same problem, how would you decide which is better? Or if you are given a single algorithm, how do you decide if it is "efficient" enough for you?
- There are some algorithmic design techniques that work for many problems. We will look at some of these:
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms

This repository serves as a collection of implementations and problem-solving approaches for the course.
